This folder includes all the data used for the thesis.

Files with the name ending in "_Financial Statements" include the company's financial statements and various 
internal and external indicators. In the sheet named "BS" you will find quarterly standardized financial 
statements for the period of 2005 - 2021 (in most cases) or for a period where data was available online. 
Financial statements data was extracted from the Bloomberg terminal and supplemented by data from the 
Nasdaq Baltic page (link - https://nasdaqbaltic.com/statistics/en/shares).
The sheet "Indicators" includes the company's financial indicators and other additional internal and 
external indicators needed for the analysis. It also consists of a few macroeconomic indicators describing
the environment in which the company operated. The company's internal indicators are calculated by me, using
the established methodology by Nasdaq OMX. External indicators are extracted from the Official Statistics
Portal (link - https://osp.stat.gov.lt/pradinis).

Other files in this folder are raw data extracted from the financial statement files.
The files are all separate for each company. They contain 34 independent variables and a dependent variable
y - the share price. The files are named by the company's alias in a stock market e.g., AUG1L for AB Auga 
Group. Each company has three different file versions, differentiated by the last number in the file name: 
y0 - includes the share price on the last day of the quarter;
y1 - share price on the last day, one month past the quarter close;
y2 - share price on the last day, two months past the quarter close.
